How to Create a New Menu
In this video, let's see how to create a new menu on UrbanPiper from scratch.

Steps to Create a New Menu
1. Click on the Create New button on the menus list.
2. Define the following four parameters for the new menu:
a. Name: The name of the menu.
b. Associated Brand: The brand associated with the menu. UrbanPiper allows
you to run multiple brands out of the same portal. You can choose any one of
these brands while creating the menu. Note that if you want to run the same
menu on two different brands, you need to duplicate the menu and
associate it with the other brand.
c. Description: A thorough description of the menu.
d. Cover Image: An image representing the menu.
3. Fill in the rest of the attributes:

a. For this example, we will call this a regular menu, a menu which the
restaurant runs on a day-to-day basis.
b. Provide a thorough description for it.
c. Upload a cover image.
4. Once all the details are filled, click on Submit to create the menu.
5. To further proceed, you can either start with creating your first section or copy
another menu.
And that's it! That's how you create a menu on UrbanPiper.

Configuring your Menu
{% embed url="https://urbanpiper.portal.trainn.co/share/oDc5q9lCcWv0jtQcs5vB4A" %}

How to Add Items and Sections to your Menu
In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to add items and sections to your menu. Follow
along to easily manage your menu items.
Step 1: Select the Menu
First, navigate to the menu you want to modify. In this example, we'll use the regular menu
associated with the Piper Pizza brand.
Step 2: Create a New Menu Section
Next, choose to create a new menu section. This will prompt you to enter the details of
your first section.
•
•
•

Name the section (e.g., "Pizzas").
Associate a schedule.
Optional: Add a description and cover image.

Once you've created your first section, you can continue to add more sections by clicking
on the "Create Section" button. For example, add another section for "Appetizers" and then
click on submit.

Step 3: Add Items to a Section
Now, let's add items to the "Pizzas" section:
•
•
•

Go to the "Pizzas" section and click on "Add Items".
Associate the pizzas from your base items.
Click "Save" to complete the associations.

Step 4: Create Subsections
Let's create a subsection under "Appetizers":
•
•
•

Go to "Appetizers" and create a subsection.
Name the first subsection (e.g., "Garlic Bread").
Associate the items (e.g., two types of garlic bread) to this subsection.

To add another subsection, follow the same steps. For example, create a subsection
called "Fries". If you don't have any fries in your items, you can create a new item on the fly
and save it.
Step 5: Edit Item Attributes
You can also edit attributes such as item name and price. For instance, you can associate
an image to an item for better visual representation.

Conclusion
And that's it! You've successfully created sections and items on your menu. Easy as that.

Adding Modifier Groups and Modifiers
{% embed
url="https://urbanpiper.portal.trainn.co/share/slUFNxGGHTfebTm7EnQmXA" %}

How to Add Modifier Groups and Modifiers to Your Menu
In this video, let's see how to add modifier groups and modifiers to your menu. Before we
get into the details of how to go about this, let's first learn about the different kinds of
modifier groups on Urban Piper.

Types of Modifier Groups on Urban Piper
There are two types of modifier groups on Urban Piper:
•
•

Add-ons: Optional modifications such as extra onion or extra chicken.
Variants: Mandatory selections that you want an end user to make while buying an
item. For example, size is a mandatory selection in a lot of restaurants, it has to be
one of regular, medium, or large.

So, the modifier group size is a modifier group of type variants, while toppings are a
modifier group of type add-ons.

Associating Modifier Groups and Modifiers to the Menu
Now that we have understood the types of modifier groups, let's move forward and
understand how to associate these on the menu. Follow these steps:
1. Open the regular menu and select the item you want to modify, for example, an 8inch golden corn pizza.
2. Click on the update button in the modifier group tab.
3. Associate the modifier group size to this pizza. Since size is a modifier group, you
will also have to associate the modifiers belonging to size.
4. If you want to create new modifiers, click on the button to enter the details and
save. However, in this case, we will associate the existing ones.
5. To change the price of a modifier, simply go and change the default sales price. For
example, if it costs 100 rupees for a regular pizza, edit the default sales price to 100
and save it.
6. Similarly, you can edit the prices of the medium and large pizzas too.
And that's it! That's how you associate modifier groups and modifiers to a menu.

Importing your Menus
{% embed url="https://urbanpiper.portal.trainn.co/share/58DqFYSuncT3xFQeAbEp4w" %}

How to Import a Menu from a POS System
In this video, we will learn how to import a menu from a POS system. If you have a live POS
integration on Urban Piper, you can make menu changes on the POS and import them to
be published on the DSPs directly. This allows you to manage your menu from a single
platform, which is your POS in this case.

Steps to Import the Menu from the POS
1. Head to Atlas and click on Menu Management.
2. Click on Menus. The screen will show you the active menu for your business.
3. Click on Import Menu.
4. Select the location from where you want to publish the menu.
5. Click on Import. A menu pull request will be triggered, and the menu will be
updated from the POS.
6. You can also import the menu directly from the POS by clicking on the menu and
selecting the menu.
Your menu import is in progress. It usually takes 2 to 5 minutes for the menu to be
updated. Once the menu is pulled from the POS, you can make the necessary changes and
publish the menu on the DSPs.

Publishing your Menu

How to Publish Your Menu on Urban Piper

Publish Now, we start the process of updating your menu as soon as you confirm
that you want to publish your changes.
Scheduled Publish: This option is used to update the menu at a later point in the
future.

Ways to Publish a Menu
Now that you've understood the difference between the two, let me show you the different
ways in which you can publish a menu on Urban Piper:
1. Through the Menus List
If you have made your changes already and simply want to publish the menu, click on
Publish Now or Scheduled Publish button on the menus list to publish your menu.
2. Within a Menu
You can also publish a menu within the menu itself:
•
•

Publish Now or Schedule Publish: Use the Publish button in the menu.
Preview Menu: To do this, select the location and platform whose menu you want
to preview. Our internal verification engine runs checks on your menu. If there are
no errors or warnings, the menu is ready to publish. Once you've verified your menu,
you can click on Publish.

Publishing Steps
1. Select the locations you want to publish to.
2. Select the platforms you want to publish to.
3. Click on Publish.

Scheduled Publish Steps
1. Click on the Scheduled Publish button.

2. Select locations and platforms in a similar way to a regular publish.
